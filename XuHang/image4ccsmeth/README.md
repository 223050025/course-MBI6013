Due to the restrictions of the domestic firewall that prevent access to overseas websites, I am unable to upload the Docker image to Docker Hub. Therefore, I saved it locally in a compressed .tar format. However, due to the file size limit on GitHub, I am also unable to upload the  compressed Docker image to GitHub. I will also try to find a way to bypass the domestic firewall restrictions.
